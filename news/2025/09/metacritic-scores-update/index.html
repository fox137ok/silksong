The PC version currently features 8 media reviews with an average score of 93, while the PS5 version achieved 92 points, and the Switch2 platform version earned the score of 90.</p>

            <h2>Critical Acclaim</h2>
            <p>Among published reviews, GamingBolt awarded a perfect score, praising Silksong as "a work that is both challenging and frustrating, yet incredibly fulfilling, masterful in every aspect."

            <h2>Differing Perspectives</h2>
            <p>However, reviews also present differing perspectives. Gamekult provided the current lowest score of 70, suggesting that "the excessive difficulty may disappoint some players." While acknowledging Team Cherry's bold attempt still presents "a unique and poetic experience," they noted the game falls short of perfection.</p>

            <blockquote>

              <cite>— GamingBolt</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Difficulty Discussion</h3>
            <p>Multiple outlets emphasized the game's high difficulty. Critics generally agree that while the game shows significant improvements in world-building, combat mechanics, and visual presentation, its demanding challenge may deter some players. The game features over 200 enemies and 40 boss battles, each requiring precise player control and deep study.</p>

            <p>Despite difficulty controversies, most reviews gave the work extremely high praise, considering it "destined to be remembered as one of the greatest 2D Metroidvania platformers of all time."</p>

          <section class="prose">
            <p class="lead">Team Cherry has announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong will receive its first official patch, primarily addressing player concerns about the game's challenging difficulty. The update will adjust early boss encounters and improve the game's economy system.</p>

            <h2>Boss Difficulty Adjustments</h2>
            <p>While the highly anticipated Metroidvania has received glowing reviews since launch, some players have criticized its punishing difficulty level over time. The patch will make adjustments to two early-game bosses: Moorwing and Sister Splinter.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Moorwing is particularly notorious for its fast-paced movement and spinning blade attacks, making it one of the most challenging early encounters.</li>
              <li>Sister Splinter, meanwhile, stays on the ceiling throughout most fights, testing players' upward mobility skills.</li>
            </ul>

              </figure>
            </div>

            <h2>Economy Improvements</h2>
            <p>Beyond boss adjustments, the patch will improve the game's economy system. Players will receive more rosaries (the game's primary currency) from relics and psalm cylinders, with increased rewards for completing courier deliveries.</p>

            <blockquote>
              We want to maintain the challenge that makes Silksong special while ensuring that early game progression feels rewarding and fair for all players.
              <cite>— Team Cherry</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Additional Changes</h3>
            <p>Additionally, Bellway and Bell Bench prices will be reduced, and using the Snitch Pick will grant more rosaries and Shell Shards. Team Cherry stated the patch is expected to arrive by "mid next week," likely before September 17th.</p>

            <p>Many players have welcomed these changes, especially the economic improvements, as insufficient rosaries for purchasing essential items and rest points has been a significant pain point for the community.</p>
